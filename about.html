     <p>
        I am Nokukhanya Tshabangu, I am currently 21 years old. I was born and
        raised in South Africa. I did my Web-developer certificate with SheCodes
        Foundation and also currently a student at North West University,
        studing electrical and electronic engineering. My journy with SheCodes
        was both enlightening and enjoyable. Juggling both school and the
        workshops was hard but worth it.My journey in this dynamic field has
        been fueled by a relentless curiosity and a commitment. On my free time,
        I read, code side projects and even volunteer at local schools to help
        kids with maths and physical sciences.

        <br />
        <br />
        I am a hardworker, with Problem-solving mindset, creative Skillset,
        Driven to continue learning Navigate challenges to provide solutions,
        Excellent communication skills, Dependable project completer
        Problem-solving mindset, Great time and task management. I thrive on the
        challenge of bringing concepts to life in the digital realm
      </p>
      <p>
        My coding journey started at university, I am studing engineering and
        thats where I was introduced to the world of coding. I did c, matlab,
        assembly and abit of c++. I never enjoyed it and found it very
        difficult, but after learning about SheCodes Foundation I decided to
        give it anather chance and try again. It was the best dicision I made
        this year, It was begginer friendly, challenging still but fun. I
        enjoyed and loved coding. As soon as I was done with the besics I knew I
        wanted to move on to Plus.The bootcamp wasn't just an educational
        experience; it was a bridge to a fulfilling and dynamic career, and I'm
        eager to see where this coding journy takes me next.
        <br />
        <br />
        So far the projects that I have done are academic ones and the ones we
        did in SheCodes, those includes, weather-app, ice-cream-order app using
        css,html and java. I found myself applying knowledge acquired earlier to
        create responsive websites and dynamic web applications. Looking forward
        to building side projects, learning more languages and building a career
        out of this skill.
